**Review Note:** These fast follow capabilities are only sketched out topically at this stage. We expect to begin addressing them after the [Introduction]({{< relref "00-intro" >}}) and [Establish Development Environments]({{< relref "01-dev" >}}) sections are completed from a draft perspective. If you have comments and suggestions about this guide, see [Contributing]({{< relref "03-contributing" >}}).

Depending on your organizations needs, additional capabilities may be required either as part of your initial build out of development environments or shortly thereafter. The following sections address the most common development "fast follow" capabilities and provide references to current best practices to establish these capabilities.
