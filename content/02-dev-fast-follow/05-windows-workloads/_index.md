**Review Note:** Given that many customers have Windows workloads that they need to run on AWS, we need to highlight the more immediate foundation capabilities related to using Windows in case those workloads are part of the initial set of workloads to be deployed into production. For example: AD integration and secure RDP access via either traditional bastion hosts or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.
