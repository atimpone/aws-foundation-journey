**Review Note:** This section will explain how the foundational capabilities that you will establish via this guide in support of your first few workloads moving into production will be just the start of an ongoing establishment of foundational capabilities.  It will use the familiar notion of "crawl, walk, run" to highlight that the initial set of capabilities and their degrees of realization as addressed in this guide is more akin to the "crawl" stage of cloud adoption.
