Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers have expressed the need for a prescriptive guide to help their organizations better understand how they can get started with the AWS platform when they are ready to move from the informal stage of using personal AWS accounts to the next stage of formally bringing a few workloads to production.

Regardless of your organization's motivation for adopting AWS, be it migrating applications and data from on-premises to the cloud, delivering new data services, or developing new modern applications, this guide is intended to help you establish an initial phase of your cloud foundation that can grow along with your adoption of AWS.
