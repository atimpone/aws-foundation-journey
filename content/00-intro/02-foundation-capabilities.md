This guide helps you establish a set of AWS foundational capabilities to help support your use of development, test, and production hosting environments for your first few initial workloads.  

Other capabilities that are specific to your workloads and your desired Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and operational processes including supporting tools are not currently addressed by this guide. You'll layer those capabilities and solutions on top of the initial foundation addressed in this guide.

## Foundation Capabilities in Scope

Initial forms of foundation capabilities addressed by this guide include:

**AWS Organizational and Account Structure**
* Centralized billing and cost management.
* An initial AWS account structure.
* Automated AWS account provisioning.
* AWS accounts for foundation management and workload hosting environments including development, pre-production, and production.

**Security**
* AWS account hardening.
* Guardrails for overall AWS environment security.
* Centralized secure logging of AWS API calls and AWS resource configuration changes.
* Federated access to the AWS platform.
* Policies for managing access to AWS accounts.
  * Cloud platform team access including cloud and security administration, audit, and finance.
  * Builder team access to team development environments.
  * Least privileged access to pre-production and production environments.

**Networking**
* Virtual networking for hosting workloads.
* On-premises network connectivity.
* Internet integration.

**Foundation Automation**
* Distirbuting foundation baseline configurations to AWS accounts.

**Review Note:** Insert a layered architecture diagram to highlight the foundational capabilities that you will establish via this guide in support of your first few workloads moving into production will be just the start of an ongoing establishment of foundational capabilities.  The upper layers of the diagram will show capabilites that are more workload and perhaps origanizational tool specific that are not addressed by the guide.  For example, what the customer puts into their team development AWS accounts is outside the scope of the guide.

## Progression of Foundation Capabilities

{{% notice note %}}
**Review Note:** This section will use the familiar notion of "crawl, walk, run" to emphasize that the initial set of capabilities and their degrees of realization as addressed in this guide is more akin to the "crawl" stage of cloud adoption and that further investment in the foundation is often needed as adoption expands.
