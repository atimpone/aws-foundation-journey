Based on almost 14 years of experience in helping customers obtain business benefits of cloud adoption, AWS has identified the following mental model to represent the [stages of cloud adoption](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/the-journey-toward-cloud-first-the-stages-of-adoption/).

Organizations leveraging these guides are typically in the “Project” stage of adoption during which they are starting with a relatively small set of people and a few projects to begin to understand how they can leverage the cloud to meet a business need.

Once an enterprise has gained some benefit from the cloud by taking a few projects to production, an organization tends to move toward a "Foundation" stage in which the organization makes more extensive investments in boths its people and its cloud foundation in support of scaling cloud adoption across the organization with the goal of gaining more extensive business benefits.
