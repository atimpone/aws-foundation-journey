**Review Note:** The fast follow capabilities are only sketched out topically at this stage. We expect to begin addressing them after the [Introduction](/00-introduction) and [Establish Development Environments](/01-dev-environments) sections are completed from a draft perspective. If you have comments and suggestions about this guide, see [Contributing](08-contributing).
