After you've addressed a few up front tasks, in about a day, this guide will help you establish an initial secure foundation in support of a set of development environments based on the following architecture.

## Value of Development Environments

This section of the guide helps your organization establish an initial foundation in support of a set of development environments. If your organization mainly focuses on integrating commercial off the shelf (COTS) software products and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, you might not have "development teams" in the traditional sense.  However, you will still benefit from establishing development environments in AWS.

Setting up development environments in AWS helps your builders experiment with and perform early testing of migration and application and data integration solutions in flexible and safe environments that are isolated from your more formally controlled pre-production test and production environments.

Compared to the cost and complexity of setting up and maintaining development environments in physical data centers, carving out virtual development environments in AWS is relatively low-cost and straightforward.

As your organization's use of the cloud matures, your builders are encouraged to begin using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to gain the benefits of greater automation. Adoption of IaC practices means that at least some of your traditional infrastructure teams will evolve to become builder teams in their own right.
